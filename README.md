   This repo contains detailed data analysis on introduction to statistics, introduction to probability, supervised learning with scikit-learn and unsupervised learning with scikit learn.

Statistics

   Statistics is the study of how to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data. It’s a hugely valuable tool that you can use to bring the future into focus and infer the answer to tons of questions. In this repo, most situations are covered using scatterplots to show the relationship between numeric values, and calculating correlation. Probability was also tackled, the backbone of statistical reasoning, and how to use Python to conduct a well-designed study to draw your own conclusions from data.

**Summary Statistics 

   Summary statistics gives you the tools you need to boil down massive datasets to reveal the highlights. In this repo, I explored summary statistics including mean, median, and standard deviation, and showed how to accurately interpret them.
    
**Random Numbers and Probability 

   In this repo, I cocered how to generate random samples and measure chance using probability. I also worked with real-world sales data to calculate the probability of a salesperson being successful. Finally, I used the binomial distribution to model events with binary outcomes.
    
**More distributions and the central limit theorem

   I created histograms to plot normal distributions and displayed examples of the central limit theorem, before working on statistical functions by adding the Poisson, exponential, and t-distributions to my repertoire.
    
**Correlation and Experimental Design

   I showed how to quantify the strength of a linear relationship between two variables, and explore how confounding variables can affect the relationship between two other variables. I also showed how a study’s design can influence its results, change how the data should be analyzed, and potentially affect the reliability of conclusions.


Supervised Learning with Scikit-Learn

   Machine learning is the field that teaches machines and computers to learn from existing data to make predictions on new data: Will a tumor be benign or malignant? Which of your customers will take their business elsewhere? Is a particular email spam? In this repo, I covered how to use Python to perform supervised learning, an essential component of machine learning. I also showed how to build predictive models, tune their parameters, and determine how well they will perform with unseen data—all while using real world datasets. I used scikit-learn, one of the most popular and user-friendly machine learning libraries for Python.

**Classification 

   Classification is the process of predicting the class of given data points. Classes are sometimes called as targets/ labels or categories. For example, spam detection in email service providers can be identified as a classification problem. This is s binary classification since there are only 2 classes as spam and not spam. A classifier utilizes some training data to understand how given input variables relate to the class. In this case, known spam and non-spam emails have to be used as the training data. When the classifier is trained accurately, it can be used to detect an unknown email. Classification belongs to the category of supervised learning where the targets also provided with the input data.
    
**Regression 

   Regression analysis is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent variable (s) (predictor). This technique is used for forecasting, time series modelling and finding the causal effect relationship between the variables. For example, relationship between rash driving and number of road accidents by a driver is best studied through regression.
    
**Fine Tuning the Model 

   Having trained the model, the next task is to evaluate its performance. Using the metrics available in scikit-learn i showed how to assess my model's performance in a more nuanced manner. I also optimized my classification and regression models using hyperparameter tuning.
    
**Preprocessing and Pipelines

   This section introduces pipelines, and how scikit-learn allows for transformers and estimators to be chained together and used as a single unit. Preprocessing techniques was used in enhancing the model performance, and the use of pipelines was also shown.
